# LunarFox

This project aims to make a private web browser that is customizable to
the fullest extent of the user, it aims to have a very well thought out
ecosystem and other privacy features to make sure your safe when browing


NOTE: this project will build of of the firefox source code so credits to
them because this wouldent be here if it wasent for theme.

This project is fairly new so i have not really rebranded all of the browser
and i have only made minimal chanes to the actual codeing of the project
as i am still learning the browsers inner workings

more building docs will come soon for now there are only a couple of commands
i havve written off the top of my head so ill make a doc and add all the 
needed steps in a future date as of now the script to run the actual exe is not 
the mozilla default i have made a script of my own in the root of the source code
which i call runconfig.py and how you run the script is you use the mozbuild tools and you cd into your project 
then run python3 runconfig.py and then your build will run after you ran the correct commands to actually build the project.
